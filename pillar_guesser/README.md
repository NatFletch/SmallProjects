# Pillar Guesser
The purpose of this project was a portfolio showcase for a music honor service fraternity I joined called Kappa Kappa Psi. This program will ask a series of questions and eventually try to figure out which pillar of KKY you align with the most.

## Known Issues
I realized after the fact that I didn't need to use pointers at all. I created this project in my first semester at university and it was right after we learned pointers so I jumped the gun a little bit but this should have been done using integers rather than integer pointers.

## Building
To build this project it's incredibly simple
- Make sure `gcc` is installed on your system.
- Run `gcc KappaPortfolio.c`
