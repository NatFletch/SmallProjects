# Vector3
The purpose of this project is for File I/O practice, dynamic allocation practice, pointer arithmatic practice, and practice developing my own custom library to perform vector math. Once again this project also uses `make` to automatically build the project on Linux machines.

## Known Issues
A lot of design decisions in this small project may seem questionable. This is mainly to practice concepts that are currently difficult to me rather than making the most optimized product. Dynamic allocation isn't really needed but I wanted to include that for extra practice

## Building
To build this project it's incredibly simple
- Make sure you have `make` and `gcc` installed
- Simply run `make` afterwards to get your binary
- Run `make clean` if you wish to remove all the object files.
